## Amazon Terminology
### 1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Think of it as renting a computer in the cloud.
### 2. Amazon Simple Storage Servive (S3)

### 3. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Storage for specific Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Think of it as the storage drive for your EC2 instance.

### 4. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

### 5. Amazon Dynamo DB

### 6. Amazon CloudFront
A fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and application programming interfaces (APIs) to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

### 7. AWS Direct Connect
Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that provides the ability to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS. Using Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

### 8. Caching
Storing frequently requested data in edge locations so that it can be accessed more quickly.

### 9. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A system of distributed servers (network) that delivers pages and other web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and the content delivery server.

### 10. Distribution
Instructs CloudFront where to get the information that it is caching in the edge locations and how to track and manage the content delivery.

### 11. Edge Locations
A site where data can be stored for lower latency. Often, edge locations will be close to high-population areas that will generate high traffic volumes.

### 12. Origin
A complex type that describes the Amazon S3 bucket, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server (for example, a web server), or other server from which CloudFront gets your files.
### 13. HDD
Slower storage that uses a spinning disk to store data.

### 14. Input/Output operations per second (IOPS)
A common performance measurement used to benchmark computer storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs).

### 15. Solid State Drive (SSD)
Very fast storage that uses flash memory instead of a spinning disk.
