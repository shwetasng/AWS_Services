## Amazon Terminology
### 1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Think of it as renting a computer in the cloud.
### 2. Amazon Simple Storage Servive (S3)

### 3. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Storage for specific Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Think of it as the storage drive for your EC2 instance.

### 4. Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

### 5. Amazon Dynamo DB

### 6. Amazon CloudFront
A fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and application programming interfaces (APIs) to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

### 7. AWS Direct Connect
Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that provides the ability to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises environment to AWS. Using Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

### 8. Caching
Storing frequently requested data in edge locations so that it can be accessed more quickly.

### 9. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A system of distributed servers (network) that delivers pages and other web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and the content delivery server.

### 10. Distribution
Instructs CloudFront where to get the information that it is caching in the edge locations and how to track and manage the content delivery.

### 11. Edge Locations
A site where data can be stored for lower latency. Often, edge locations will be close to high-population areas that will generate high traffic volumes.

### 12. Origin
A complex type that describes the Amazon S3 bucket, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server (for example, a web server), or other server from which CloudFront gets your files.
### 13. HDD
Slower storage that uses a spinning disk to store data.

### 14. Input/Output operations per second (IOPS)
A common performance measurement used to benchmark computer storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs).

### 15. Solid State Drive (SSD)
Very fast storage that uses flash memory instead of a spinning disk.

### 16. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Involves the application of controls to users who need access to computing resources.

### 17. Role
An IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.

### 18. User
An entity that you create in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.

### 19. Security Group
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### 20. Policy
An object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or a resource, defines its permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal entity (user or role) makes a request.

### 21. Amazon Inspector
Helps customers identify security vulnerabilities and deviations from security best practices in applications, before they are deployed and while they are running in a production environment;; An automated security assessment service. It helps you test the network accessibility of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and the security state of your applications running on the instances.

### 22. Group
An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

### 23. Root User
When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.

### 24. Credential
AWS security credentials verify who you are and whether you have permission to access the resources that you are requesting.

### 25. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
This approach to authentication requires two or more independent pieces of information to be authenticated.

### 26. AWS Shield
A managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### 27. AWS WAF
A service that gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules.

### 26. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
A syntax for storing and exchanging data.

### 27. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
A security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.

### 28. Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
A malicious attempt to make a targeted system, such as a website or application, unavailable to end users. To achieve this, attackers use a variety of techniques that consume network or other resources, interrupting access for legitimate end users.

### 29. AWS artifact
A central resource for compliance-related information. It provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements.
