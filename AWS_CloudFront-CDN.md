## USING CloudFront AS A CDN FOR WEBSITE
### Using CloudFront to create content delivery network (CDN) for a website that is stored in Amazon S3
### Task 1. Create an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI
- In this task, you will create an S3 bucket using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). The AWS CLI is an open-source tool that you can use to interact with AWS services using commands in your command line shell.

1. Choose the **Service**s and **Developer Tools** and choose **CloudShell**. <img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/61bbc894-38f2-4205-a16f-dbaf0f0d7a12">

   - If a welcome pop-up window appears, choose **Close**.
   - AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that gives you command line access to your AWS resources in the selected AWS Region.

2. Copy and paste the following code into a text editor:
   ```text
   cd ~
   aws s3api create-bucket --
   bucket (bucket-name) --
   region us-east-1
   ```
3. In the code that you copied, replace (**bucket-name**) with a unique Domain Name System (DNS)-compliant name for your new bucket.
   - Follow these naming guidelines:
     - The name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3.
     - The name must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
     - The name can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
     - The name must begin and end with a letter or number.
     - The name must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.168.5.4).
     - After you create the bucket, you cannot change the name, so choose wisely.
     - Choose a bucket name that reflects the objects in the bucket. This is because the bucket name is visible in the URL that points to the objects that youâ€™re going to put in your bucket.

**Note**: The us-east-1 Region has been entered in the command. When you create a bucket, the best practice is to choose a Region close to you to minimize latency and costs, or to address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a Region never leave that Region unless you explicitly transfer them to another Region.
4. Run the updated code in the CloudShell terminal.
   - If a pop-up window appears, choose **Paste**.
   - The output should look similar to the following:

    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_handson/assets/110754474/5632556b-6580-4293-90be-287b48b6feba)

**Note** : When you create a bucket with this command, the bucket is open to the public. We recommend that you keep all settings enabled unless you know that you need to turn off one or more of them for your use case, such as to host a public website.

### Task 2. Add a bucket policy
5. In the console, choose the **Services** menu, locate the **Storage** section, and choose **S3**. <img width="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/fb0aee00-9a51-458a-8bea-ec409e6a2695">

         ]
      }
    ]
    }
    ```
11. In the policy, replace **example-bucket** with the name of your bucket. <img width="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/b664bf7f-6721-49df-810a-d774dfed5992">

34. Copy the **Domain Name** value for your distribution and save it to a text editor to use in a later step.
35. Create a new HTML file to test the distribution.
    - Find and download an image from the internet.
    - Navigate to your S3 bucket and upload the image file to it, making sure to grant public access as you did when uploading the HTML file earlier in this lab.
      <img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/ba060fef-3ecc-4086-b680-4d772ab16ad2">

    - Create a new text file using Notepad and copy the following text into it:
      ```text
      <html>
      <head>My CloudFront Test</head>
      <body>
        <p>My test content goes here.</p>
        <p><img src="http://domain-name/object-name" alt="my test image">
      </body>
      </html>
      ```
     - Replace **domain-name** with the domain name that you copied earlier for your CloudFront distribution.
     - Replace **object-name** with the file name of the picture file that you uploaded to your S3 bucket.
     - The edited line of code should look similar to the following:
       ```text
       <p><img src="http://d2f1zrxb2zaf30.cloudfront.net/picture.jpg" alt="my test image">
       ```
     - Save the text file with an HTML extension.
       <img width="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/f8434dca-91d3-4872-9265-95fed53ccb58">

36. Use an internet browser to open the HTML file that you just created.
    <img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/b7d61bce-20e4-4c98-afe0-f9750a868700">

- If the image that you uploaded shows, your CloudFront distribution was successful. If not, repeat the lab.
