# Module 4 Lab 2: Creating an S3 Bucket
## Lab overview
Follow these steps to create an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to host a static website.

A static website is fixed and displays the same content for each user. In contrast, a dynamic website uses advanced programming to provide user interaction and display different content depending on the user's selections.

## Duration
This lab requires approximately **30 minutes** to complete.

## Access the AWS Management Console
1. To start the lab session, choose :arrow_forward: Start Lab in the upper-right corner of the page.

    - The lab session starts.
    
    - A timer displays in the upper-right corner of the page and shows the time remaining in the session.

**Tip:** To refresh the session length at any time, choose **Start Lab** again before the timer reaches 0:00.

Before continuing, wait until the lab environment is ready. The environment is ready when the lab details appear on the right side of the page and the circle icon next to the AWS link in the upper-left corner turns green.

2. To return to these instructions, choose the  Readme link in the upper-right corner.

3. To connect to the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS link in the upper-left corner, above the terminal window.

A new browser tab opens and connects you to the AWS Management Console.

**Tip:** If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon is usually at the top of your browser with the message that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon, and then choose **Allow pop-ups**.

**Note:** You are using the console through the lab environment, so you are not incurring any actual costs. However, in the real world, when using a personal or business account to access the console, users incur charges for use of specific AWS services.

## Task 1. Create an S3 bucket
4. Choose the **Services** menu, locate the **Storage** services, and select **S3**.

5. Select **Create bucket** on the right side of the page.

6. For **Bucket name**, enter a unique Domain Name System (DNS)-compliant name for your new bucket.

Follow these naming guidelines:

- The name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3.
- The name must only contain lowercase characters.
- The name must start with a letter or number.
- The name must be between 3 and 63 characters long.
- After you create the bucket, you cannot change the name, so choose wisely.
- Choose a bucket name that reflects the objects in the bucket. This is because the bucket name is visible in the URL that points to the objects that youâ€™re going to put in your bucket.
7. For **Region**, choose the AWS Region where you want the bucket to reside.

Choose a Region close to you to minimize latency and costs, or to address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a Region never leave that Region unless you explicitly transfer them to another Region.

8. Uncheck the Block all public access box because you want to be able to test if the website is working.

A warning message similar to Turning off block all public access might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public appears below the security setting you deselected.

9. Below the warning, check the box next to I acknowledge that....

Your new bucket appears in the Buckets list.

## Task 2. Add a bucket policy to make the content publicly available

13. To grant public read access for your website, copy the following bucket policy, and paste it in the policy editor.
```text
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect":"Allow",

                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource":[
                "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

14. In the policy, replace example-bucket with the name of your bucket.<img width="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shwetasng/AWS_Services/assets/103261868/5983a865-d8c3-4de5-a643-3dd823c88cef">
